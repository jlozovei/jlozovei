## Hey there ðŸ‘‹
Nice to meet you!

My name is Julio, and I work as a front-end developer. :man_technologist:  
I'm currently democratizing the delivery service over the interior of Brazil and fostering entrepreneurship at [Delivery Much](https://github.com/delivery-much).

To know more about my work, take a look on [my repos](https://github.com/jlozovei?tab=repositories) or go to my website:  
[jlozovei.dev](https://jlozovei.dev) :globe_with_meridians:

There you'll find my portfolio and some of my thoughts over technology and development. :books:

See ya! :metal:
